        Method-2:
        time conplex: O(n) -> in worst case we have to visit all the element
        from the list.
        space compx: O(n)

        approach would be
        1. create empty dict to keep track of visited numbers.
        2. loop through all the elements from the list and get
            the index and item
        3. check if target - curent-numner present in dict
        4. if yes then simply return the stored index and current index.
        5. if not then store the current value and index to the dict.

        '''

        # enumerate will return the index and the value
        visited = {}  # keep track of all visited numbers
        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            # checking if we have values in visited dict.
            if target - num in visited:
                return [visited.get(target - num), idx]
            visited[num] = idx  # if not add it to dict
